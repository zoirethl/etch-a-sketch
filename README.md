# Etch-A-Sketch Project

Welcome to my Etch-A-Sketch project! In this project, I'm building a web-based sketchpad that combines the creativity of a sketchpad with the simplicity of an Etch-A-Sketch. It's a great opportunity for me to practice and improve my DOM manipulation skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a sketchpad with the following features:

1. A 16x16 grid of square divs that can be manipulated.
2. The grid divs are generated dynamically using JavaScript.
3. The grid divs are organized in a container div and styled to form a grid using CSS and flexbox.
4. The squares in the grid change color when the mouse hovers over them, leaving a trail as if drawing with a pen.
5. A button at the top of the screen allows the user to set the number of squares per side for the new grid, ensuring a responsive and interactive sketchpad.

## Extra Credits (Optional)
### Future updates:

1. Transform the square's behavior when interacting with the mouse:
   - Instead of a simple color change, randomize the square's RGB value entirely.
